	<p>So far in Computer Science 1, I have learned the building blocks to creating a website in HTML code. This includes learning about the head and body sections. I have also learned about divs, which are simply things that appear on the screen. The style section is a subset of the head and describes the divs, assigning them a color or an image or a size. I feel that there are a lot of resources that I can use to further my knowledge and make websites that include more elements. I am working on my first website, which will have randomized things taken from a database. I am excited to work on this idea and plan to have my journals, projects, and home pages somewhat mapped out over the coming weeks.</p>
