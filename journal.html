	<h2>October 3, 2021</h2>
	<p>So far in Computer Science 1, I have learned the building blocks to creating a website in HTML code. This includes learning about the head and body sections. I have also learned about divs, which are simply things that appear on the screen. The style section is a subset of the head and describes the divs, assigning them a color or an image or a size. I feel that there are a lot of resources that I can use to further my knowledge and make websites that include more elements. I am working on my first website, which will have randomized things taken from a database. I am excited to work on this idea and plan to have my journals, projects, and home pages somewhat mapped out over the coming weeks.</p>
	<h2>October 18, 2021</h2>
	<p>I now feel more accustomed to using Sublime Text and Terminal. I am planning on placing the menu on my home page on the journals and projects pages. Then, I will work on projects and continue to add journals. Eventually, I want to have a calendar appear on the journals page so that journals can be accessed chronologically. For example, if the 14th of October was clicked on, this entry would appear. </p>
	<h2>October 19, 2021</h2>
	<p>This week, I made <a href="panel.html"> a CSS animation of a plane flying </a>. Our assignment was to make a CSS animation and I thought a plane would be an appropriate way to express movement. I learned how to use CSS to style an animation and change the placement of the animated thing. I'm frustrated that I feel it takes me a while to do simple things, so it is hard to make progress with my website without spending a lot of time. </p>
	<h2>October 31, 2021</h2>
	<p>A variable is something that changes over time, while a function involves one or more variables to be executed and for the change to take place. A function runs when the function name followed by parentheses followed by a semicolon is placed in JavaScript. Some of the words I've learned in JavaScript include var, appendchild, and setinterval. In my codesketches, I use functions to create hands waving and circles that appear from left to right in several rows on the screen. </p>
