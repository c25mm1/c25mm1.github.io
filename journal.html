	<p>So far in Computer Science 1, I have learned the building blocks to creating a website in HTML code. This includes learning about the head and body sections. I have also learned about divs, which are simply things that appear on the screen. The style section is a subset of the head and describes the divs, assigning them a color or an image or a size. I feel that there are a lot of resources that I can use to further my knowledge and make websites that include more elements. I am working on my first website, which will have randomized things taken from a database. I am excited to work on this idea and plan to have my journals, projects, and home pages somewhat mapped out over the coming weeks.</p>
	<h2 id="Entry2">October 18, 2021</h2>
	<p>I now feel more accustomed to using Sublime Text and Terminal. I am planning on placing the menu on my home page on the journals and projects pages. Then, I will work on projects and continue to add journals. Eventually, I want to have a calendar appear on the journals page so that journals can be accessed chronologically. For example, if the 14th of October was clicked on, this entry would appear. </p>
	<h2 id="Entry3">October 19, 2021</h2>
	<p>This week, I made <a href="panel.html"> a CSS animation of a plane flying </a>. Our assignment was to make a CSS animation and I thought a plane would be an appropriate way to express movement. I learned how to use CSS to style an animation and change the placement of the animated thing. I'm frustrated that I feel it takes me a while to do simple things, so it is hard to make progress with my website without spending a lot of time. </p>
	<h2 id="Entry4">October 31, 2021</h2>
	<p>A variable is something that changes over time, while a function involves one or more variables to be executed and for the change to take place. A function runs when the function name followed by parentheses followed by a semicolon is placed in JavaScript. Some of the words I've learned in JavaScript include var, appendchild, and setinterval. In my codesketches, I use functions to create hands waving and circles that appear from left to right in several rows on the screen. </p>
	<h2 id="Entry5">November 11, 2021</h2>
	<p>Recently, I've learned about using functions to pull random things from a list or set. I'm working on an art gallery codesketch using that skill so that a different painting appears after the page is clicked. </p>
	<h2 id="Entry6">November 22, 2021</h2>
	<p>I created two new projects based on arrays. In one project, the image changes to different Minesweeper symbols when it is clicked on. In the other project, the image changes to different Thanksgiving symbols when clicked on. For these projects, I had to create a list of images and an event listener to cause a random image to be pulled from the list when a click happens.  </p>
	<h2 id="Entry7">December 6, 2021</h2>
	<p>I created a winter holiday themed gift. The gift is a CSS Animation of a candle hovering over a menorah. In creating this animation, I used keyframes to place the candle in different positions at different times within the 4 second animation, which repeats perpetually. </p>
	<h2 id="Entry8">January 12, 2022</h2>
	<p>I am working on coding data representation based on the Winter Olympics in advance of the upcoming Winter Olympics in Beijing next month. For my code, I need to create an event listener so that outlines of countries fill up with the amount of medals that country has won in previous Winter Olympics. The event listener will cause this to happen when a button is clicked. </p>
	<h2 id="Entry9">February 7, 2022</h2>
	<p> I finished working on <a href="norway.html"> a data representation of the all time Winter Olympics medal counts </a>. The page shows the flags of the top 3 countries in total Winter Olympics medals won, Norway, the USA, and Germany. In the flags are the medals won, Gold, Silver, and Bronze, corresponding to the order of the countries overall. For example, the USA ranks second overall, so the page shows the number of silver medals they received. </p>
	<h2 id="Entry10">February 13, 2022</h2>
	<p> I am working on <a href="index2.html">a presentation </a> to test out reveal.js. The presentation includes transitions, different types of text, images, an embedded website, and more. </p>
	<h2 id="Entry11">February 27, 2022</h2>
	<p> I am working on <a href="thank.html">a project </a> that randomizes color and text. So far, I have included the element of random color by having different colored rectangles appear on a click. </p>
	<h2 id="Entry12">March 6, 2022</h2>
	<p> I have some questions about concepts that I want to understand better:
	1. How should I format an if/else statement?
	2. When making a counter, what is the part of the function that makes the counter count?
	3. How  is setTimeout different from setInterval?
	4. How can you change the class of an element in JavaScript?
	5. What are different types of loops and what do they do/mean?
	6. What happens when a value is undefined?
	7. How do you exit or enter a loop?
	9. How can you randomize text in an array/for loop?
	10. How would you make clicking in one place trigger an event in a different place on the screen?
	 </p>
	 <h2 id="Entry12">April 4, 2022</h2>
	<p> I have been working on resolving my questions in codesketches. For example, my <a href="norway.html">spring themed codesketch </a>. I have also been considering the following questions about technology and how I can address them in codesketches: 
	1. How do sounds make technology more addictive?
	2. How do tech companies change after being acquired?
	3. How are character faces/icons in games chosen?
	4. How should I successfully set reminders to do things?
	Finally, I am editing my home page to have less blank space.
	</p>
	<h2 id="Entry13">April 14, 2022</h2>
	<p> I have added a<a href="corona.html">new codesketch based on a game</a>. 
	</p>
	</p>
	<h2 id="Entry14">April 20, 2022</h2>
	<p> I plan to create a karaoke project which will use a p tag to create text on the screen. I will change  the text through an event listener with the amount of time before the text needs to change. I will have an audio tag that plays a song. </a>.
